## Own Image Classifier Project - Udacity Artificial Intelligence With Python Nanodegree Program

**Introduction**

Welcome, Amazon AI&ML Scholarship recipient, to the Artificial Intelligence With Python Nanodegree Program at Udacity! This program, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), equips you with the skills to excel in the field of AI.

This README.md file provides a roadmap for your Own Image Classifier Project. You'll build a custom image classifier using Python and Deep Learning techniques, working with real-world datasets to train a model for accurate object or scene identification.

**Project Goals**

- Grasp the fundamentals of image classification and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Apply Python programming skills to image data and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Train, evaluate, and optimize a CNN model for image classification.
- Document your project with clarity and informative visualizations.

**Resources**

- **Udacity Course Materials:** Access project requirements, rubrics, and guidance within your Nanodegree program. Leverage video lectures, readings, and interactive exercises covering AI and Deep Learning concepts.
- **Optional Resources:**
    - TensorFlow Tutorials: [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
    - PyTorch Tutorials: [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
    - Deep Learning Book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville: [https://www.deeplearningbook.org/](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

**Project Deliverables**

1. **Jupyter Notebook:** Your primary coding environment for building the image classifier. Ensure well-documented code, explaining each step of model development.
2. **Project Report (Optional):** A report summarizing your approach, key findings, and lessons learned. Include visualizations and results showcasing your project's success.

**Submission Guidelines**

- Refer to specific submission instructions within your Udacity Nanodegree program.
- Ensure well-structured, documented, and easy-to-understand code.
- Provide clear instructions for running the code and viewing results.

**Success Tips**

- Thoroughly review Udacity course materials.
- Leverage provided resources to deepen your understanding of image classification techniques.
- Document your work clearly, test thoroughly, and iterate to improve model performance.
- Don't hesitate to seek help from Udacity mentors or the broader AI community.
